### Astronomy is broadly divided into two main branches: observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy. These branches complement each other, with observational astronomy providing data that theoretical astronomy seeks to explain and model.

<b><u>Observational Astronomy</u></b>
<p>The Focus of Observational astronomy is centered around in acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects and phenomena.</p>
<p>It aims to collect as much information as possible from the electromagnetic radiation such as light or radio waves which are emitted or reflected by celestial bodies.</p>
