### Astronomy is broadly divided into two main branches: observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy. These branches complement each other, with observational astronomy providing data that theoretical astronomy seeks to explain and model.

<b><u>Observational Astronomy</u></b>
<p>The Focus of Observational astronomy is centered around in acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects and phenomena.</p>
<p>It aims to collect as much information as possible from the electromagnetic radiation such as light or radio waves which are emitted or reflected by celestial bodies.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lets explore some Methods and Tools:</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first tool which we are going to explore are the Telescopes. Here are some types of telescopes used in astronomy</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Optical Telescopes which Use lenses or mirrors to gather and focus visible light. Examples include refracting telescopes (which use lenses) and reflecting telescopes (which use mirrors).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there are Radio Telescopes which are used to Detect radio waves from space. These telescopes have large parabolic antennas and are used to study radio emissions from galaxies, quasars, and other astronomical objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Space Telescopes: Positioned outside Earth’s atmosphere to avoid atmospheric distortion and light pollution. Examples include the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Infrared Telescopes: Detect infrared radiation, which is useful for observing objects obscured by dust or that emit most of their energy in the infrared spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">X-ray and Gamma-ray Telescopes: Observe high-energy radiation from phenomena like black holes, neutron stars, and supernovae.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now lets understand the term Spectroscopy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   Spectroscopy Involves analyzing the spectrum of light emitted or absorbed by objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   Spectroscopes split light into its component colors, revealing information about the object’s composition, temperature, velocity, and more.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">3.Photometry:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Measures the intensity of light from astronomical objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Useful for studying variable stars, supernovae, and other phenomena that change brightness over time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> Imaging:</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Captures detailed images of celestial objects using CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Modern imaging techniques include adaptive optics, which compensate for atmospheric distortion, and interferometry, which combines signals from multiple telescopes to enhance resolution.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> Data Analysis:</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Involves processing and interpreting the vast amounts of data collected from observations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">   &#8211; Astronomers use various software tools and statistical methods to analyze the data, extract meaningful information, and identify patterns.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Applications of Observational Astronomy:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; Observational astronomy helps us discover new celestial objects, understand their properties, and monitor changes over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; It provides empirical evidence to support or refute theoretical models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211; Key discoveries include the identification of exoplanets, the mapping of cosmic microwave background radiation, and the observation of distant galaxies and black holes.</span></p>
