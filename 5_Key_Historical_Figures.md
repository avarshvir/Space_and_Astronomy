# The evolution of astronomy from ancient to modern times highlights the pivotal contributions of key figures who reshaped our understanding of the universe:

1. **Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – c. 170 CE)**: In his work "Almagest," Ptolemy established the geocentric model, positioning Earth at the center of the universe, which dominated Western thought for over a thousand years.

2. **Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543)**: Copernicus introduced the heliocentric model in "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium," placing the Sun at the center and challenging the Ptolemaic system, paving the way for the Scientific Revolution.

3. **Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642)**: As the first to use a telescope for systematic observations, Galileo's findings—including the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus—provided crucial support for the heliocentric model, leading to conflict with the Catholic Church.

4. **Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727)**: Newton's "Principia Mathematica" unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics through his laws of motion and universal gravitation, solidifying the heliocentric view.

This journey illustrates humanity's enduring quest for knowledge, building upon the insights of these astronomers to deepen our understanding of the cosmos.
